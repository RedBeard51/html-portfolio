<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hi, my name is Troy and this is the first website I've ever coded and made from scratch. What do you
  think? My mom thinks it's pretty sweet but she would prefer more pictures of
  dogs instead of all the cats. Too bad ma!

  This may be my first website coded from scratch using HTML, but it is not my
  first website design. I have used Wix before but that is a templated website designer app. It was great for getting started and learning the creative, visual side of web design, but that wasn't enough. I needed to know what was behind the template. I need to know the fundamentals of how it all works. That's what drives me.

  This was a lot of fun, and I can't wait to learn CSS and JavaScript to make even more websites. What do you think my nedt website project should be? I'm thinking a blog to document my journey through the programming world. Or, maybe a movie review site? Hit me up through the contact info and let me know what I should do next.
